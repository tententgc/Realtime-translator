# Translating My Own Voice into a Different Language, as I Speak!

This project aims to develop a real-time voice translation tool that captures your voice, processes it, and instantly translates it into another language while maintaining the speaker's unique vocal tone and cadence. The tool leverages speech recognition, natural language processing, and voice synthesis to provide seamless, live language translation. Whether for cross-cultural conversations, international meetings, or personal language practice, this project pushes the boundaries of voice and language technology!

## Key Features

- **Real-time voice capture and translation:** Instantly translates spoken words into another language while preserving the speaker's voice and intonation.
- **Multi-language support:** Supports various languages and can dynamically adjust input language during translation.
- **Customizable voice synthesis:** Reproduces the speaker's voice in the translated language.
- **Powered by GPT-4-Turbo:** Leverages advanced translation capabilities for natural, nuanced translations.

Here is the updated guide with the new Step 4 included:
